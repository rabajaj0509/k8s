To upgrade the Kubernetes cluster, we must
first upgrade the kubeadm tool itself.

To know which new release is available for
upgrade use the kubeadm tool.

master$ kubeadm version
master$ kubeadm upgrade plan

Upgrade the master node:

master$ kubectl drain master --ignore-deamonset
master$ apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.17.0-00
master$ kubeadm upgrade apply v1.17.0

Next step is to upgrade your kubelet:

master$ apt-get install -y kubelet=1.17.0-00
master$ systemctl restart kubelet
master$ kubectl uncordon master

Once, the master node is upgraded, we
need to upgrade the worker nodes.

master$ kubectl drain node-01 --ignore-deamonset
master$ ssh node-01
node-01$ kubeadm upgrade node
node-01$ apt-get upgrade kubelet=1.17.0-00
mode-01$ systemctl restart kubelet

master$ kubectl uncordon node-01
