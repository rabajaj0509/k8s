i. To mark a node as unschedulable or
corden a node, use the `drain` command.

```
$ kubectl drain node-01
```

ii. To mark a node unschedulable you can
also use the `cordon` command. Unlike the
`drain` comand, it does not terminate or move
the pods on an existing node.

```
$ kubectl cordon node-02
```

iii. To schedule pods again on a restricted
node, use the `uncordon` command.

```
$ kubectl uncordon node-01
```
