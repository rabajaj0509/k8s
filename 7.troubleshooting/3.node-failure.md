Node Failture

1. Check the status of the node in the cluster

```
$ kubectl get nodes
$ kubectl describe node worker-node-1
```

In the describe command, the status can be true,
false or unknown.

```
OutOfDisk: kubelet does not have sufficient disk space available
MemoryPressure: Kubelet does not have sufficient memory available
DiskPressure: Kubelet has disk pressure
PIDPressure: Kubelet does not have sufficient PID available
Unknown: when the worker node stops communicating with the master
```

2. If the node is crashed, check for:

```
$ top
$ df -h
$ service kubelet status
$ sudo journalctl -u kubelet
$ openssl x509 -in /var/somepath/worker.crt -text (check
the certificate is valid and the correct CA cert is used)
```
